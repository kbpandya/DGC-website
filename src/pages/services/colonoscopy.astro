    A colonoscopy is a safe, effective procedure used to examine the inner lining of your large intestine (colon and rectum). It is considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> for colon cancer screening and prevention.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mb-2 mt-0">When should I get screened?</h3>
    <p class="mb-0 text-description">
      Current guidelines recommend that average-risk adults begin screening at <strong>age 45</strong>. If you have a family history of colon cancer, you may need to start sooner.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Before the Procedure</h3>
  <p>
    To ensure a thorough examination, your colon must be completely empty. You will be prescribed a "bowel prep" liquid to drink the day before. While this is often considered the most challenging part of the process, it is critical for a successful screening.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">During the Procedure</h3>
  <p>
    You will be given a sedative to ensure you are comfortable and relaxed. Most patients sleep through the entire exam and feel no pain. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (colonoscope) into the rectum. A tiny video camera at the tip allows the doctor to view the inside of the entire colon. If polyps are found, they can often be removed right then and there. The entire exam typically takes <strong>20 to 45 minutes</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">After the Procedure</h3>
  <p>
    You will spend a short time in our recovery area while the sedative wears off. Because of the sedation, <strong>you will need someone to drive you home</strong>. Most patients can return to a normal diet immediately and resume normal activities the next day.
