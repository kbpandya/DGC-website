    While colon cancer is the most discussed, cancers of the upper digestive tract—such as esophageal, stomach, and pancreatic cancer—also require vigilance, especially for patients with specific risk factors.
  </p>

  <h2 id="esophageal-cancer">Esophageal Cancer & Barrett's Esophagus</h2>
  <p>
    Chronic acid reflux (GERD) can lead to a condition called <strong>Barrett's Esophagus</strong>, where the lining of the esophagus changes. This increases the risk of esophageal cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Screening:</strong> An <a href="/services/upper-endoscopy" class="text-accent-dark hover:underline">Upper Endoscopy (EGD)</a> is used to examine the esophageal lining. If Barrett's Esophagus is found, regular surveillance can detect precancerous changes early.
  </p>

  <h2 id="stomach-cancer">Stomach (Gastric) Cancer</h2>
  <p>
    Screening for stomach cancer is not routine for everyone in the U.S. but may be recommended if you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A family history of stomach cancer</li>
    <li>Chronic <em>H. pylori</em> infection</li>
    <li>History of stomach polyps or ulcers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="pancreatic-cancer">Pancreatic & Liver Cancer</h2>
  <p>
    Screening for these cancers typically involves imaging tests (like Ultrasound, CT, or MRI) and blood tests. It is usually reserved for individuals with high risk due to genetics or chronic conditions like Cirrhosis or Chronic Pancreatitis.
