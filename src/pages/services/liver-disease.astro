  <h2 id="fatty-liver">Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)</h2>
  <p>
    Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is becoming increasingly common. It involves excess fat stored in liver cells, which can lead to inflammation and scarring over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Management:</strong> We focus on lifestyle modification, weight loss, and monitoring liver health to prevent progression to cirrhosis.
  </p>

  <h2 id="cirrhosis">Cirrhosis Management</h2>
  <p>
    Cirrhosis is the late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions. While scarring cannot be reversed, treatment can stop or delay further damage and manage complications.
