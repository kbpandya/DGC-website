    Capsule Endoscopy allows your doctor to examine the middle part of your gastrointestinal tract (the small intestine), which cannot be easily reached with traditional upper endoscopy or colonoscopy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    The procedure involves swallowing a vitamin-sized capsule that contains a tiny wireless camera. As the capsule travels through your digestive tract, it takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder you wear on a belt.
  </p>

  <h2 id="why-its-done">Why is it Done?</h2>
  <p>
    It helps doctors find the cause of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding</li>
    <li>Inflammatory bowel diseases (like Crohn's disease)</li>
    <li>Small intestine tumors or polyps</li>
    <li>Unexplained abdominal pain</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="procedure-day">The Procedure Day</h2>
  <p>
    The process is simple and painless:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You swallow the capsule with water in the morning at our office.</li>
    <li>You go about your normal day (with some dietary restrictions).</li>
    <li>You return to the office in the afternoon to return the recorder.</li>
    <li>The capsule passes naturally in your stool (you do not need to retrieve it).</li>
  </ol>
