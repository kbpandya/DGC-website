    An Upper Endoscopy, also known as EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy), is a procedure used to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).
  </p>

  <h2 id="why-its-done">Why is an Upper Endoscopy Done?</h2>
  <p>
    This procedure helps your gastroenterologist diagnose and treat conditions affecting the upper digestive tract. It is often recommended for investigating symptoms such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent heartburn or acid reflux (GERD)</li>
    <li>Difficulty or pain when swallowing</li>
    <li>Unexplained nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Upper abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Preparation</h3>
  <p>
    Preparation for an EGD is generally simpler than for a colonoscopy. You typically need to fast (no food or drink) for 6 to 8 hours before the procedure to ensure your stomach is empty. Your doctor may also adjust your medications.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Procedure</h3>
  <p>
    You will receive a sedative to help you relax and likely sleep through the procedure. The doctor will gently guide a thin, flexible tube with a camera down your throat. The procedure typically takes only <strong>10 to 20 minutes</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Recovery</h3>
  <p>
    After the procedure, you will be monitored until the sedation wears off. You may experience a mild sore throat, which usually resolves quickly. <strong>You will need a driver to take you home</strong> due to the sedation.
