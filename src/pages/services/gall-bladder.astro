    Your gallbladder helps digest fats, but when things go wrong, it can cause severe pain. We provide expert diagnosis and management plans for gallbladder disease.
  </p>

  <h2 id="symptoms">Common Symptoms</h2>
  <p>
    Gallbladder issues often present as "attacks" of pain, particularly after eating fatty meals. Look out for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sudden, intense pain in the upper right abdomen</li>
    <li>Pain radiating to the right shoulder or back</li>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>Digestive problems (bloating, gas)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="conditions">Conditions We Treat</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Gallstones (Cholelithiasis):</strong> Hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can block bile ducts.</li>
    <li><strong>Cholecystitis:</strong> Inflammation of the gallbladder.</li>
    <li><strong>Biliary Dyskinesia:</strong> When the gallbladder doesn't empty bile correctly, causing pain without visible stones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">How We Diagnose It</h2>
  <p>
    We utilize a combination of physical exams, Ultrasounds, HIDA scans (to check gallbladder function), and blood tests to pinpoint the cause of your pain.
