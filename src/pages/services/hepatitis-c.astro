    Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. Today, thanks to advances in medicine, Hepatitis C is <strong>curable</strong> in most cases.
  </p>

  <h2 id="understanding-hepc">Understanding Hepatitis C</h2>
  <p>
    Many people with Hepatitis C do not know they have it because they often have no symptoms. Over decades, however, the virus can slowly damage the liver, leading to cirrhosis (scarring) or liver cancer.
  </p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis & Treatment</h2>
  <p>
    We start with a simple blood test to detect the virus. If active infection is found, we evaluate the health of your liver using blood work and non-invasive imaging.

    <p class="mb-0 text-green-700">
      Modern Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medications can cure over 95% of persons with Hepatitis C infection. Treatment typically involves taking pills for 8 to 12 weeks with few side effects.

  <p>
    Even after the virus is cured, if you have existing liver scarring, ongoing monitoring is essential. Our team specializes in liver disease management to keep your liver as healthy as possible.
