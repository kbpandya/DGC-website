    A PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) procedure is used to place a flexible feeding tube through the abdominal wall and into the stomach.
  </p>

  <h2 id="purpose">Why is a PEG Tube Needed?</h2>
  <p>
    This procedure allows nutrition, fluids, and medications to be put directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus. It is often recommended for patients who:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) usually due to neurological conditions like stroke or ALS.</li>
    <li>Cannot take enough food by mouth to maintain nutrition.</li>
    <li>Are undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="procedure">The Procedure</h2>
  <p>
    The procedure is performed using an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera). It is generally quick and safe.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You will be sedated for comfort.</li>
    <li>The doctor guides the endoscope into the stomach to find the best site for the tube.</li>
    <li>A small incision is made in the abdomen to insert the feeding tube.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="care">Living with a PEG Tube</h2>
  <p>
    Our team provides comprehensive training for patients and caregivers on how to use and care for the PEG tube to prevent infection and ensure proper nutrition.
