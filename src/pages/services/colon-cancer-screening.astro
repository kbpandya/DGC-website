    Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The good news is that it is also one of the most <strong>preventable</strong> cancers with timely screening.
  </p>

  <h2 id="importance">Why Screening Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Colon cancer almost always starts as a small growth called a <strong>polyp</strong>. Screening tests allow doctors to find and remove these polyps <em>before</em> they turn into cancer. If cancer is found, finding it early significantly improves the chances of successful treatment.

    <p class="mb-0 text-gray-700">
      The American Cancer Society now recommends that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at <strong>age 45</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="options">Screening Options</h2>
  <p>
    While there are several ways to screen for colon cancer, the <strong>Colonoscopy</strong> remains the gold standard because it allows for both detection and removal of polyps in a single procedure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Colonoscopy:</strong> The most comprehensive test. Examines the entire colon.</li>
    <li><strong>Stool Tests (Cologuard/FIT):</strong> Non-invasive tests that look for blood or altered DNA in stool. If positive, a follow-up colonoscopy is required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
  <p>
    You may need to start screening earlier than age 45 if you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps.</li>
    <li>Inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease).</li>
    <li>Certain genetic syndromes (like Lynch syndrome).</li>
  </ul>
