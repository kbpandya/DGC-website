    <p class="mb-0 text-description">
      The American Cancer Society now recommends that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at <strong>age 45</strong>.

  <h2 id="options">Screening Options</h2>
  <p>
    While there are several ways to screen for colon cancer, the <strong>Colonoscopy</strong> remains the gold standard because it allows for both detection and removal of polyps in a single procedure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Colonoscopy:</strong> The most comprehensive test. Examines the entire colon.</li>
    <li><strong>Stool Tests (Cologuard/FIT):</strong> Non-invasive tests that look for blood or altered DNA in stool. If positive, a follow-up colonoscopy is required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
  <p>
    You may need to start screening earlier than age 45 if you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps.</li>
    <li>Inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease).</li>
    <li>Certain genetic syndromes (like Lynch syndrome).</li>
  </ul>
